## Project Highlights

- Recommends top 5 similar movies based on input
- Uses basic ML techniques like TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
- Clean and modular Python code
- Beginner-friendly structure

## Objective

To build a basic movie recommendation system that demonstrates understanding of:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Similarity calculation
- Output ranking based on accuracy

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
